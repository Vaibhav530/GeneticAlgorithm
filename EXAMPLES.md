# Examples of ga2
Currently [ga2](../) can be used for most of the discrete optimisation problems, after [installing](README.md). Run the code as follows.
```
$ python3 <example-code>.py
```
### Single agent performance evaluateion
In this case, each agent is sent out as an object where the agent's fitness is updated externally and sent back to session. After all the agents have been sent out and got back, the next generation is generated, example for which is in [singleAgentUpdate.py](examples/singleAgentUpdate.py)

### Current Development
I have made the example templates as shown above for now and there have been no notable errors in the above examples. Do report any bugs if found

Proposals of new ideas or scenarios is a welcome !
